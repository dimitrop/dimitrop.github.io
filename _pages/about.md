I am an Associate Professor at the
[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.uoa.gr)
(NKUA) in the [Department of Business Administration](https://www.ba.uoa.gr/en/),
and Head of the Reliability Engineering Directorate at the
[National Infrastructures for Research and Technology](https://grnet.gr/en/) (GRNET),
where I have led the design and implementation of advanced infrastructures
supporting critical digital governance services.

I received my Ph.D. in
[Secure Software Development Technologies](https://thesis.ekt.gr/thesisBookReader/id/43152#page/1/mode/2up)
from the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en)
in 2014 under the supervision of Professor [Diomidis Spinellis](https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/),
and subsequently worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the
[Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at
[Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with Professor
[Angelos Keromytis](https://angelosk.github.io/).

I am interested in building software that is both reliable and secure.
My research combines ideas from software engineering, computer security,
programming languages, and systems.
I believe in bridging the gap between theoretical advances and
practical tools that can be readily adopted in real-world development.
